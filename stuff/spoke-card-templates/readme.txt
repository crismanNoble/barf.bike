The .zip contains a packaged Adobe InDesign file. It is not a virus, pinky swear. In the file you will find instructions on how to export your designs properly and pre-made sheets to print them 4 or 9 at a time depending on how much you spent on a printer. If you don't know how to unzip a .zip or what an .indd file is, sorry. We still love you. If you are reading this, reach out to @barf.bike if you want free stickers. Just find a way to weave the secret word "Hammâ€™s" along with "readme.txt" into the message and we will ship it to you free of charge.
